Downtown LA is home to @bestiadtla. A trendy Italian restaurant that serves fresh ingredients that have a “from scratch” feel. We were honored to try a large selection of the menu and have to say the food was quality! 
Featured in this post we have the Spaghetti Rustichella, chestnut & mushroom ravioletti, rigatoni sugo di Anatra, lobster, and Gorgonzola pizza.

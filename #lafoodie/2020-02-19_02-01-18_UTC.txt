In this delicious Miso Shiitake Mushroom dish, we use sake to deglaze the pan in order to help capture the caramelized bits of food stuck to the it. On top of that, the sake adds a sweet savory flavor with a touch of acid that helps enhance the flavor of the mushrooms. A small addition that creates big impact in your meal. 🍄💥

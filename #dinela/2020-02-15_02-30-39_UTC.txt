Hot Chicken from the recently opened @hotvillechicken. 
From a descendant of the family that arguably created hot chicken, the Prince family of Nashville. This rendition is good but I’d put LA’s Howlin’ Rays and Dave’s well ahead. We ordered the hottest and second hottest heat levels and they were pretty manageable as far as spice level.

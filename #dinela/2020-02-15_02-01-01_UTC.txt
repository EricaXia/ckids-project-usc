Tangy-sweet and smoky with a pleasant kick, romesco sauce is the perfect companion to these lightly charred shrimp, but then it’s pretty much magic everywhere it goes. We especially love it on sandwiches, like roast beef or prosciutto panini — or even avocado toast. Don’t stop there, this lush sauce should be spooned over scrambled eggs, swirled into soup, and dabbed on roasted broccolini! ⁠

BBQ jackfruit sliders 😳😋 Honestly, a favorite of mine now. The jackfruit had a nice crispiness to it and the slaw and sauce were sooooo good!!! Highly recommend this place! Ocado is a super cute spot right on busy Ventura Blvd. They have great service and staff, and they also do a taco night! $5 taco duo and $5 draft! 👌 👍 We will be back! •

We were clementine devotees — until we had @sumocitrus. A cross between mandarin and navel oranges, the enormous Sumo (aptly named, no?) is similar to its better-known compadres. Oh, except it’s sweeter, juicier, tangier, and way easier to peel. Also: no seeds! We love putting them on salads, smoothie bowls, and vanilla ice cream for a bright kick. (But if we’re being totally honest, we eat one every time our tummies get the slightest bit grumbly.)

Don’t you for cheddar ‘bout me 🧀
GUYS
I’ve been in Instagram jail for the past week and I’m finally out 🚔
I was commenting back on my own posts when it happened so I’ll get back to you ASAP 😡
ANYWAY 
A week ago, I went to @fritzicoop at @steelcraft with @lbfoodcoma and @umamitraveler for a dope meal and to work on my photography skills 📸
We got treated to the secret menu 🤐
Not so secret anymore, eh? 🍔
If you want a fat sammy that’s so spicy it will stay with you for days, then get this spicy chicken sando with some mac, mkay? 🍜🔥
I have about a thousand cool shots from here, which is kind of like a food form of torture because I can’t decide which ones to post 🌝 anyone else have this 1st world prob??

The day has come... it is officially 24 HOURS UNTIL MALAMA PONO OPENS TO THE PUBLIC! 🙌🏼 We are beyond grateful for the love and support we have had through this journey and we are fortunate to be able to be booked out before opening! Thank you to all of you and we cannot wait to share our gorgeous place with everyone 💕We are live on @resy so please join us as soon as you can! We hope you love it as much as we do 🌅 .

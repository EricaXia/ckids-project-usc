Sometimes itâ€™s not about the greasy-cheesy-carbs-galore food, sometimes itâ€™s just about the good for you, for me, for everyone kind of food.

This is what BotÃ¡nica Restaurant & Market is to us- simple, nourishing, & deliciously balanced food. Itâ€™s one of our all time favorites, created by Emily Fiffer & Heather Sperling (long time food writers/editors), who had a vision for vibrant, locally-sourced, & nutritious foods.

Weâ€™ve been here several times, we always like to bring people who are visiting L.A. here. Itâ€™s a great way to show off Californian cuisine & the space is super cute! You can also browse the little indoor market with some California favorites, including some delicious wines.
The food here is refreshing and light, you always leave feeling like you treated yourself.

We love love the Turkish Eggs! Cake for Breakfast is always a must for us. The Morning Mezze is a great starter to share with a small group, itâ€™s so colorful & savory.
All in all, weâ€™ll always be coming back. Highly recommend coming to this little gem!
